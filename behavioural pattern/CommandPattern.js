//! The command pattern allows encapsulation of the requests or operations into separate 
//! objects. It decouples the objects that send requests from the objects responsible for 
//! executing those requests.

//! Consider an example where the client is accessing the methods of an API directly 
//! throughout the application. What will happen if the implementation of that API changes? 
//! The change will have to be made everywhere the API is being used. To avoid this, we 
//! could make use of abstraction and separate the objects requesting from those implementing 
//! the request. Now, if a change occurs, only the object making the call will need to change.

//! Invoker: asks the command to carry out the request
//! Command: has information about the action and binds it to the receiver by invoking the 
//! corresponding operation on it
//! Receiver: knows how to perform the operations associated with the command
//! Client: creates a command and sets the receiver whoâ€™ll receive the command
