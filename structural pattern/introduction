As the name implies, these patterns are concerned with object relationships and the 
structure of classes or objects. They help to add new functionality without having to 
modify the entire system. They ensure that if one part of a system changes, the whole 
system does not change with it.

The structural patterns we will cover in this chapter include:
Decorator pattern
Facade pattern
Adapter pattern
Bridge pattern
Composite pattern
Flyweight pattern
Proxy pattern
