//! the proxy pattern is a structural pattern that creates a proxy object. It acts as a 
//! placeholder for another object, controlling the access to it.

//! Usually, an object has an interface with several properties/methods that a client can 
//! access. However, an object might not be able to deal with the clientsâ€™ requests alone 
//! due to heavy load or constraints such as dependency on a remote source that might cause 
//! delays (e.g., network requests). In these situations, adding a proxy helps in dividing 
//! the load with the target object.

//! The proxy object looks exactly like the target object. A client might not even know 
//! that they are accessing the proxy object instead of the target object. The proxy handles 
//! the requests from the clients and forwards them to the target object, preventing undue 
//! pressure on the target.


//! The proxy can also act as a cache and store the requests. When the same request is made 
//! again, it can just return it from the cache rather than forwarding it to the target. 
//! This allows the target to deal with a lesser number of requests.

//! The proxy pattern tries to reduce the workload on the target object. You can use it 
//! when dealing with heavy applications that perform a lot of network requests. Since 
//! delays could occur when responding to such requests, using a proxy pattern will allow 
//! the target object to not get overburdened with requests.

//! A real-life example is HTTP requests. These are expensive operations, therefore, 
//! the proxy pattern helps in reducing the number of requests forwarded to the target.
