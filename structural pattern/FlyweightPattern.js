//! It is a structural pattern that focuses on how related objects share data. It helps 
//! prevent repetitive code and increases efficiency when it comes to data sharing as well 
//! as conserving memory.

//! This pattern takes the common data structures/objects that are used by a lot of objects 
//! and stores them in an external object (flyweight) for sharing. You could say that it is 
//! used for caching purposes. So, the same data does not need to have separate copies for 
//! each object, instead, it is shared amongst all.

//! A flyweight is an independent object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously. 
//! It cannot be distinguished from the instances of objects that are not sharable. 
//! A flyweight object can consist of two states:

//! intrinsic: this state is stored in the flyweight. It contains the information required 
//! by the internal methods of objects. It is independent of the context of the flyweight 
//! and is sharable with other objects.

//! extrinsic: this state depends on the context of the flyweight and it cannot be shared. 
//! Normally, the client objects pass the extrinsic state to the flyweight object when needed.

//! In the code above, we used the flyweight pattern by introducing the FormatterFactory 
//! class. Whenever an instance of a language formatter is requested, it checks if the 
//! instance already exists or not. If it does, it returns the same one. Else, it creates a 
//! new instance.

//! So now, if 1,000 users come online to format a Python file, 1,000 instances of the same 
//! formatter need not be created. Instead, a single instance will be shared by everyone.

//! The formatter instance created in this example, that is, the Python or Java formatter, 
//! is our flyweight object. It contains the function, format used to format all different 
//! sorts of code file objects. This means all code file objects will require this function, 
//! so instead of creating copies for each, it is accessed from the flyweight object instance.


//! This pattern should be used when your application has plenty of objects using similar data or when memory storage cost is high. JavaScript uses this pattern to share a list of immutable strings across the application.

//! This pattern is mostly used in applications like network apps or word processors. 
//! It can also be used in web browsers to prevent loading the same images twice. The 
//! flyweight pattern allows caching of images. Therefore, when a web page loads, only the 
//! new images are loaded from the Internet, the already existing ones are fetched from the cache.
