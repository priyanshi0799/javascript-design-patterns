//! The MVC pattern stands for model view controller pattern. It is an architectural 
//! pattern used to organize the code of your application. It consists of three components:

//! Model:
//! This is the model component that manages the data that the application may require.

//! View:
//! The view is used for the visual representation of the current model. It renders data on 
//! the userâ€™s side.

//! Controller:
//! The controller connects the model and the view components.

//! The model is independent of the view, meaning, it is not concerned with the user interface 
//! and how the information is displayed on the user side. The view, on the other hand, is 
//! an observer of the model. Whenever the model gets modified (data is updated), 
//! it notifies its observer (the view) which then reacts accordingly.

//! As mentioned, view is the visual representation of the model. Whenever it is notified of 
//! a change in the model, the view updates correspondingly. As the view layer is what the 
//! users get to see, this is also the layer they get to interact with, such as editing or 
//! updating attribute values.

//! The controller is the connection between the model and the view. The controller takes 
//! input from the user such as a click or keypress which updates the view side and then updates 
//! the model. It can sometimes update the view directly as well.

//! You can use this pattern if you want:
//! improved application organization in your application.
//! faster development so that developers can work on different components of the application 
//! simultaneously.
//! to develop an application that loads fast as MVC supports asynchronous technique.
//! multiple views for the model.
//! to increase the scalability of the application as modification in separate components is easier
